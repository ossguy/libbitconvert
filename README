This is the README for libbitconvert, a library that decodes bits from magnetic
stripe cards into the ALPHA and BCD formats and provides a list of fields and
values for cards described in the formats file.

To build the library and test driver, run "make" from the root directory.  This
should work on any POSIX system, such as Ubuntu, Mac OS X, or Windows with
MSYS.  libbitconvert requires libpcre, which is available in Ubuntu 8.04 and
8.10 by running "sudo apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev" and should be
available in Mac OS X with Xcode.  libpcre for Windows can be obtained from
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/pcre.htm in "Complete package, except
sources".

To use the library, you can run "./driver" (the test driver), which reads ASCII
1s and 0s from standard input.  The driver expects Track 1 data to be on the
first line of standard input, Track 2 data on the second line of standard
input, and Track 3 data on the third line of standard input.  To specify no
data for a particular track, simply use an empty line.

Example bitstreams are available in the test_data directory.  You can run them
through the test driver using a command like "./driver < test_data/eb_edge".

Alternatively, you can write your own application that #includes bitconvert.h
and links with libbitconvert.a, but beware that the API is not yet stable so
you may have to update your application regularly to keep up with the changes.
