This is the README for libbitconvert, a library that decodes bits from magnetic
stripe cards into the ALPHA and BCD formats and provides a list of fields and
values for cards described in the formats file.

To build the library and test driver, run "make" from the root directory.  This
should work on any POSIX system, such as Ubuntu, Mac OS X, or Windows with
MSYS.

To use the library, you can run "./driver" (the test driver), which reads ASCII
1s and 0s from standard input.  Alternatively, you can write your own
application that #includes bitconvert.h and links with libbitconvert.a, but
beware that the API is not yet stable so you may have to update your
application regularly to keep up with the changes.

For more information on the ALPHA and BCD formats, see
